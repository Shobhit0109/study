The settlements require the companies to strengthen their data security procedures and submit to audits for 20 years. These are the FTC‰Ûªs first cases against credit report resellers for their clients‰Ûª data security failures.



‰ÛÏThese cases should send a strong message that companies giving their clients online access to sensitive consumer information must have reasonable procedures to secure it,‰Û said David Vladeck, Director of the FTC‰Ûªs Bureau of Consumer Protection. ‰ÛÏHad these three companies taken adequate steps to ensure the use of basic computer security measures, they might have foiled the hackers who wound up gaining access to extensive personal information in the consumer reporting system.‰Û



According to administrative complaints issued by the FTC, the three resellers buy credit reports from the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) and combine them into special reports they sell to mortgage brokers and others to determine consumers‰Ûª eligibility for credit. Due to their lack of information security policies and procedures, the companies allegedly allowed clients without basic security measures, such as firewalls and updated antivirus software, to access their reports. As a result, hackers accessed more than 1,800 credit reports without authorization via the clients‰Ûª computer networks. In addition, even after becoming aware of the data breaches, the companies did not make reasonable efforts to protect against future breaches.",http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/02/settlement.shtm,2/3/2011,Unknown,Insufficient Authorization,Leakage of Information,Finance,,No,,,,,,Credit Records,"1,800",

The vulnerability enables the malicious website to impersonate any other websites to cheat Facebook, and obtain the same data access permissions on Facebook those websites receive. Bing.com by default has the permission to access any Facebook users' basic information such as name, gender, etc, so our malicious website is able to de-anonymize the users by impersonating Bing.com. In addition, due to business needs, there are many websites requesting more permissions, including accessing to a user's private data, and publishing content on Facebook on her behalf. Therefore, by impersonating those websites, our website can obtain the same permissions to steal the private data or post phishing messages on Facebook on the user's behalf.

The exploit is generic, so we do not need to write an exploit for each Facebook app/website.

2011-1,WHID 2011-1: Hackers hit Tunisian websites,"Online activists have attacked and at least momentarily disabled several Tunisian government websites in the latest act of protest against the country's embattled leadership.



As of Monday afternoon, local time, at least eight websites had been affected, including those for the president, prime minister, ministry of industry, ministry of foreign affairs, and the stock exchange.



The attack, which began on Sunday night, coincided with a national strike, planned to take place on Monday, that organisers said would be the biggest popular event of its size since Zine El Abidine Ben Ali assumed the presidency.



The strike comes on the day that school students return from their holiday.



Ben Ali's administration has tightly restricted the flow of information out of Tunisia since widespread protests began on December 17, following 26-year-old Mohamed Bouazizi's suicide attempt. But reports of civil disobedience and police action filtered out on Twitter on Monday, with some users reporting the use of tear gas by security forces. 



The loosely organised hacker group Anonymous claimed responsibility for the cyber attack, which it called ""Operation Tunisia"", an apparent arm of the group's broader effort - termed ""Operation Payback"" - aimed at taking retribution against governments and businesses viewed as hostile to the similarly amorphous document-leaking group WikiLeaks.",http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201113111059792596.html,1/2/2011,Denial of Service,Insufficient Anti-automation,Downtime,Government,Tunisia,Yes,Operation Tunisia,8,,,,,,

As with many websites, iTunes tells users to select a socalled 'security question' from a list of options when they first set up their account.
These are fairly basic and include 'what is your mother's maiden name?' and 'where did you spend your honeymoon?'.
Customers who have forgotten their passwords are prompted with the question they first selected when they set up their profile - as long as they give the correct answer, they can access the account.
Security analysts claim this is leaving the website wide open to fraud.
Hackers simply pretend they are a customer who has forgotten their password and can easily work out the answer to the personal question using information that users have posted on social-networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter.",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1280354/Got-iTunes-account-Thats-music-cyber-fraudsters-ears.html,22-May-10,Brute Force,Insufficient Password Recovery,Session Hijacking,Web 2.0,USA,No,,,,,,,,

2010-93,WHID 2010-93: Huge 'sexiest video ever' attack hits Facebook,"A huge attack by a rogue Facebook application last weekend infected users' PCs with popup-spewing adware, a security researcher said Monday.



On Saturday, AVG Technologies received more than 300,000 reports of the malicious Facebook app, said Roger Thompson, AVG's chief research officer. AVG came up with its tally by counting the number of reports from its LinkScanner software, a free browser add-on that detects potentially poisoned pages.



""It was stunning, really, the number,"" said Thompson in an interview via instant message late Monday. ""And stunning that it was not viral or wormy [but that] Facebook did it all by itself.""



The volume of reports on Saturday's rogue Facebook software was highest during the nine-hour period between midnight and 9 a.m. Eastern, with spikes of approximately 40,000 per hour coming at 7 a.m. and noon. For the day, AVG received more than 300,000 reports, triple that of AVG's second-most-reported piece of spyware.



According to Thompson, Facebook eradicated the rogue application about 15 hours after the attack started. Facebook's only acknowledgment of the attack came on its security page, where a ""Tip of the Week"" Monday morning read: ""Don't click on suspicious-looking links, even if they've been sent or posted by friends.""",http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9176905/Huge_sexiest_video_ever_attack_hits_Facebook,18-May-10,Rogue 3rd Party App,Insufficient Process Validation,Planting of Malware,Web 2.0,USA,No,,,,Facebook,,,,

Clicking on the link sends a request to CNN which instructs the browser to send a second request to the redirect URL ‰ÛÒ in this case the shortened http:/bit.ly/cP‰ÛÓXW.  The host site would not be aware of the misuse ‰ÛÒ the spammer is simply abusing legitimate ad-serving functionality.

This technique provides several advantages to the spammer:

2)      The reputable site name would allay fears of anything malicious lurking at the end of the click.

The challenging part is that these types of defensive mechanisms may actually interfere with many of the automated bot programs that investors use to monitor and execute trades.  Online trading fraud is not going to go away anytime soon.

2010-26,WHID 2010-26: Russia Arrests Alleged Mastermind of RBS WorldPay Hack,"A fascinating story about a group of hackers who broke into the RBS WorldPay DBs through SQL Injection.  Russian authorities have nabbed the man accused of masterminding a coordinated global ATM heist of $9.5 million from Atlanta-based card processing company RBS WorldPay.  The hackers compromised RBS WorldPay‰Ûªs database encryption to raise the amount of funds available on the compromised cards, and boost their daily withdrawal limits. In some case, the hackers raised the limits to $500,000.  According to the indictment, Tsurikov conducted reconnaissance of the RBS network after Covelin provided him with information about vulnerabilities in the system. Pleshchuk and Covelin then worked on exploiting the vulnerabilities to obtain access. Pleschuk allegedly developed the method for reverse engineering the encrypted PINs.  Once the hackers raised the account limits, they provided an army of cashers with 44 cards programmed with the account details. On November 8 that year, the cashers simultaneously hit more than 2,000 ATMs, netting about $9.5 million in less than 12 hours.



The story did not specify the exact vulnerabilities exploited to manipulate the DB however the Indictment PDF (in the reference) lists actual SQL commands sent to the DBs (pages 10-11).



If you then cross-reference this story with WHID entry 2009-51 where the Romania Hacker Unu released SQL Injection vulns in RBS WorldPay web applications, it seems most plausible that these Russian Hackers used similar vulnerabilities.",http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/alleged-rbs-hacker-arrested,22-Mar-10,SQL Injection,Improper Input Handling,Monetary Loss,Finance,"Georgia, USA",No,,,Russia,,,,,http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2009/11/rbs-worldpay-indictment.pdf

What is going on?



The attackers were able to get access to Rackspace databases and infect the sites through there. They created a new admin user on many Worpress sites, giving them full access to the WordPress admin panel.



With that access they were able to inject malware, and as we saw before they used that to inject SEO spam to the sites.



One of the posts in that thread also suggests that the attack vector is a vulnerable version (2.11.3) of phpMyAdmin used by RackSpace Cloud. If this is true, hackers must have targeted an XSRF attack at one of RackSpace admins with mySql root permissions to gain access to the whole database (probably created one more admin user).

The security hole was uncovered by Goatse Security, a group known among security experts as hackers who enjoy pulling Web pranks, Gawker reported. Still, the group previously has uncovered flaws in browsers Firefox and Safari, Gawker said.

Once the hole was uncovered, he said, the group was able to write a script that would automatically predict ID numbers and return the associated e-mail addresses.

</table>

<p>It all started on Sunday, June 7<sup>th</sup>: someone broke into the web servers of VAServ, a tiny UK based hosting company. The hackers ruined many of VAServ virtual servers. Some of them lost were for ever as the snippet from VAServ home page, serving as an emergency bulletin board, shows.</p>

<p>As tiny as VAServ is, probably no more than 3 people, in today's virtual and flat world they could serve tens of thousands of low cost web sites, many of them now lost for ever. Behind each one of these web sites there is a story of someone who worked hard, whether on a hobby or a small business and is now left with nothing. A comment made on one of the blog entries about the incident reads:</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>""yeah thanks for ruining my life for the last 2 years i had built up my site spending alot of money and giving up my job for nothing.........what am i going to tell the wife?""</em></p>

<p>Just think about tens of thousand of such stories. Daniel Voyce, a web developer using VAServ for all of his clients, told the <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/08/webhost_attack/"">Register: </a></p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>""Since last night, I've had probably 40 phone calls from clients saying 'Why is my website down, It's making me look bad.""</em></p>

<p>But this domino effect ruining so many small businesses had another even more devastating angle. Just days before the hack, someone <a href=""http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/8880"">posted on milw0rm</a> a long list of yet unpatched vulnerabilities in Kloxo, a virtual machine management software. The list certainly looks comprehensive enough to enable anyone to penetrate a site using Kloxo, which VAServ where, leading VAServ and others to believe that LxLabs, the Bangalorian software company behind Kloxo is the culprit. Somebody claiming to be the hacker <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/25617/update-new-information-on-the-vaserv-hack-that-wiped-100k-sites/"">commented to the inquistir blog</a>, claiming that weak password at VAServ where to blame for the hack, which <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/10/vaserv_follow_up/"">Rus Foster from VAServ denied</a>.</p>

<p>We may never know who is right and who is wrong. LxLabs, just like Vaserv, is a tiny company using the Internet to look big. However one area that suffers a lot in small companies, is their security. It is never important enough to invest resource in security in such a lean and mean operations.</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.xiom.com/sites/default/files/ligesh.jpg"" width=""179"" height=""206"" style=""float: right;"" />But tiny giants have another weakness: it all falls on the shoulders of too few people.

2009-43,WHID 2009-43: Web Mail Company to Pay Prize After CEO Hacked,"What does a challenge to break an web mail system and get $10,000, broken within minutes prove? Is it a lesson in vanity? Or about the state of web security? Or about security in general. Probably all.



The most obvious observatoins is that offering $10,000 for anyone who can break your site and being broken within an hour shows that you don't know what you taking about. Maybe it would be a lesson to all security vendors to not believe their own marketing verbiage. A quick browse of the bugtraq vulnerability archives will show how insecure and easy to evade security products can be.



However, judging from the number and seriousness of the incidents reported on the web hacking incidents database, StrongWebmail is not alone and far stronger companies suffers severe incidents, making web applications the weakest link in an organizations information security.

2009-42,WHID 2009-42: Puerto Rico sites redirected in a DNS attack,"Attacking web sites by going to the source, targeting DNS servers rather than the web sites themselves shows both the boldness of hackers as well as the fragility of the Internet.



While not new, DNS hijacking attacks took an important turn this year showing how much we rely on the web and now little we care for its protection. In the past DNS hijacking required complete control over the DNS server. In recent years most applications are controlled through a web interface, including DNS servers. Earlier this year attackers found an XSS vulnerability in a common DNS platform to hijack unused DNS entries for phishing



But this was only a small prelude to the real thing. CNet reports that this time hackers took over an entire TLD (Top Level Domain, or country) DNS server using SQL injection, virtually defacing the Puerto Rican site of companies such as Google and Microsoft.



The amazing story unfolds in the comments to CNet story, which outlines a mischievous professor and slow authorities who let him privatize and monetize on domain registration in Puerto Rico without any control.

The question whether they are legally responsible is open.



Another issue is defining a malware. Many times ads are used to entice users to download and install programs that are questionable. a rootkit installed through a known browser vulnerability is a malware, however the distinction between adware and malware is many time blurred and depends on:

<p>This time <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/17/time_top_100_hack/"">a <span>hacker</span> <span>succeeded</span> in manipulating</a> <span>Time's</span> poll for most <span>influential</span> people in 2009.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1883644_1886141,00.html""><img src=""http://www.xiom.com/sites/default/files/images/time_poll_hacked.png"" alt=""Top results for the hacked Time poll"" width=""480"" height=""156"" /></a></p>

<p>Such poll are probably always <span>distorted</span> by automated programs,&nbsp; with every stakeholder running his own robot to promote a cause. The <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1883644_1886141,00.html"">current time poll status</a> <span>Shawn</span> above includes mostly known people, though the standings do seem skewed. Is it just that our view of the world is different than others, or have <span>Muslims</span> around the world become avid Time readers? The top rated person, ""moot"", which none of you heard about until now, proves that it is all about automation.</p>

<p>This specific poll distortion <a href=""http://musicmachinery.com/2009/04/15/inside-the-precision-hack/"">reported by Paul <span><span>Lamere</span></span></a> is unique since a group of hackers called 4chan, led by ""moot"", took the time to fight Time's humble attempts to mitigate automation. Among the measures and countermeasures that 4chan and Time exchanged are:</p>

<ul>

<li>4chan distributed the simple get URL required to vote for moot through legitimate web sites and comment spamming. Such a link can easily be executed automatically by a web site user without his awareness using CSRF techniques.</li>

<li>Using a typical CSRF counter measure, Time added a salted and hashed key to ensure that the poll was submitted from its own poll form. However the key was authentication on the client by <span>Time's</span> poll Flash application <span>enabling</span> 4<span><span>chan</span></span> to easily find it out and overcome the issue. </li>

<li>The Time voting mechanism did not even check that the ranking in the vote was legal, so a link to vote down ""moot"" competitors in the list was also used until Time fixed the issue. Voting down is key to winning such a poll as 4chan competitors are not at rest running their own sophisticated campaigns.</li>

<li>Lastly 4chan developed sophisticated robots to auto-vote. Those robots overcome Time's anti-automation protections: since each user is allowed to vote just once in every 13 seconds, the robots uses open proxies to vote faster. Since time only prevents voting for the same person from the same IP, the robots used the extra 12 seconds available for each source IP to vote down competitors. The system also reports to a central server allowing monitoring of the voting rate!</li>

<p><img src=""http://www.xiom.com/sites/default/files/images/Mikeyy_270x246.png"" alt=""Mikeyy Mooney, the Twitter worms creator"" width=""270"" height=""246"" style=""float: right;"" />Mikeyy's worm is a good example of how CSRF and XSS can be combined to create a strong blended attack, in this case a propagating worm. A Web 2.0 community generated site such as twitter is often vulnerable to stored XSS . This often implies that a user can update his own profile with malicious code and as a result others who view his content get hit. Without any other vulnerability to complicate things, you are safe as long as your friends are trustworthy.</p>

<p>However, if the site is also vulnerable to CSRF, the XSS exploit can include in addition to the payload also the original XSS inflicting code run under the attacked users credential, modifying his content and therefore hiting his own friends, which hit their own friends and so on.</p>

It is responsible for one for one of the 1st application layer worm, <a href=""/whid-2004-14"">Santy</a> back in 2004. How ironic is that its own web site was seriously breached due to a vulnerability in another software package used...</p>

<p>The culprit was an<a href=""http://www.bugreport.ir/index_60.htm""> LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability in PHPlist</a>, an application for managing newsletters which enables the hacker to grab phpBB users list. Another researcher <a href=""http://www.suspekt.org/2009/02/06/some-facts-about-the-phplist-vulnerability-and-the-phpbbcom-hack/"">claims </a>that this is not an LFI but a super-globals-overwrite, which is still used to include files.</p>

<p>However, phpBB is not entirely off the hook, as the phpBB team <a href=""http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=71&amp;t=29973"">admits</a>. The stolen files included only hashed passwords, however phpBB 2 hash was unsalted and the hackers successfully brute forced 28,000 passwords. While phpBB 3, which is used on the phpBB site uses better password hashing, the upgrade procedure did not upgrade existing users waiting for their 1st login to upgrade. Anyone who did not log-in to the web site since the upgrade still had weakly hashed password in the database.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://hackedphpbb.blogspot.com/2009/01/place-holder.html"">very detailed report </a>of the incident by the hacker shed light on how such hacks are carried out, including what the hacker went after and his exploitation techniques .

Just thinking about the questions I would be asked if my daughter would get such pages.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/04/school_website_defacement/"">incident </a>also highlights the total breakup of cyber security. The incident is blamed on an unpatched version of Moodle, an open source on-line education software. The naive way ot thinking would be that schools don't have the budgets to protect their applications or even to upgrade them. However, as this incident shows, proper security is fundamental and a substantial part of the budget should be allocated to it, even it means we spend less on the application features. We need to move slower but ensure security. After all, what is the value of an educational system that shows porn?</p>

<p>Another insight is that real time controls for protecting web applications are essential. You need a WAF. While the specific vulnerability exploited is unknown, Installing <a href=""/modsecurity"">ModSecurity</a> would have probably prevented the exploit.</p>",,30-Jan-09,Known Vulnerability,Application Misconfiguration,Defacement,Education,UK,No,,,,Moodle,,,,
2009-15,WHID 2009-15: Kanye West has been Hacked,"<p>Celebrities web presence hacking is topping 2009 incidents list, and rappers seem to lead.

<p>West's story is somewhat ironic as he used his blog to remind users of the untruthfulness of his web presence.</p>

2009-12,WHID 2009-12: Embassy of India in Spain found serving remote malware through iFrame attack,"<p>Ismael Valenzuela sent us <a href=""http://blog.ismaelvalenzuela.com/2009/01/26/embassy-of-india-in-spain-found-serving-remote-malware-through-iframe-attack/"">a story</a> about yet another malware through iFrame serving site. This time it is an official one, belonging to the Indian government official branch in Spain - it's embassy.</p>

<p>We can hardly include every malware service site in WHID, after all there are hundred of thousands, if not millions, of those. Why pick on the Indian embassy in Spain? One good reason is that we finally got in an input from a reader and wanted to honor the event and include the incident. But there is another more important reason.</p>

<p>First, <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/23/embassy_sites_serve_malware/"">hacked embassy sites are becoming a major issue</a> which points to a much larger issue: cyber crime is endangering the Internet as we know it. While we come to rely on the web to provide us with all the information and services that we need, we do not have the tools to make it a safe place, and embassy web sites are a good example.</p>

<p>Practically the only way to provide sufficient security to a web site is not to have it in the first place. Instead small organizations must rely on the services of huge brokers, such as Amazon, eBay or Google sites. However not everyone can use this services. Embassies are a good example as they need to be ""doubly localized"" for both the originating and target countries which makes it nearly impossible to create a uniform service for them. Therefore even embassies of larger countries need to create small home made and insecure web sites, as they need to adjust their site content, language and site look to the local community served.</p>

2009-1,WHID 2009-1: Gaza conflict cyber war,"Update (Jan 13, 2009) - Ynet, an Israeli paper, reports that many of the sites defaced where actually DNS hijacked following a break-in to the servers of DomainTheNet, an Israeli registrar. And just like other recent DNS hijacking incidents, the fault was lack of sufficient authentications and the hackers got hold of passwords to the administration system.



Update (Jan 10, 2009) - Zone-H reports that in addition to Israeli sites, Turkish hackers are also targetting USA and Nato web sites using SQL injection.



The war in Gaza, like most modern wars, moved immediately to cyberspace. Islamic and Arab groups all over the world are using the Internet to retaliate against Israeli web sites. Some of the reported incidents are:

<a href=""http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/158570"">Israeli bank site hacked by an Islamic group</a></li>

<a href=""http://www.darkreading.com/security/attacks/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212700313"">Hundreds of Israeli web sites hacked in 'Propaganda War'</a>



Like every war, this one is not one sided. Interestingly enough, since this is a war between a country and a Guerrilla organization, and the cyber war which focus on mostly on conquering the minds of people is shaped similarly. The Israeli cyber war activity is mostly funneled through legal channels rather than hacking, as described by <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/12/israels-info-wa.html"">Wired</a>.



However, unlike the physical war in which only the Israeli military is conducting, in cyberspace Israelis join by themselves the hacking war. Artuz 7, an Israeli media site, <a href=""http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/129223"">reports </a>that a group of students released a tool that perform distributed denial of service attacks against Hamas web sites. The <a href=""http://www.help-israel-win.org/index.php?lang=eng"">students site itself</a> provides news alerts about the cyber war between Israel and the Hamas.

<hr />

<p>Celebs are fast becoming a prime hacking target. Miley Cyrus already made her debut at WHID when her Twitter account was raided. But it seems that this was not her first cyber incident for her. As <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/10/miley-cyrus-hac.html"">reported by Wired</a>, late last year a hacker named  Josh Holly published private photos of Ms. Cyrus stolen from her G-mail account.</p>

<p>The hack was a relatively sophisticated one and a very good example of the risks of Web 2.0. Holly penetrated a MySpace administrator using social engineering. Using the account he gained access to a list of passwords which MySpace stored in an unencrypted form. Unbelievable. Since most of us use the same password for multiple services, Holly used Cyrus' MySpace password on her G-mail account gaining access and retrieving the photographs.</p>

<p>In a related but yet unconfirmed story Holly claims to have used the MySpace administrative account for an advertising scam by which he gained $50,000.</p>",,20-Oct-08,Administration Error,Application Misconfiguration,Leakage of Information,Web 2.0,,No,,,,,,,,

Spotify is a new music streaming radio like service from Sweden. A weakness in <a href=""http://www.spotify.com"">Spotify </a>streaming protocols enables hackers to gain access to users' encrypted passwords, email address, birth date, gender, postal code and billing receipt.</p>

<p>An interesting aspect of this incident is that while the vulnerability has been discovered and fix on December 19<sup>th</sup>, the fact that it was actually exploited was discovered only in March 2009. Many times companies report that a vulnerability was found on there site, but they are not aware of any exploit of the vulnerability.

<p>Read the comments, they are enlightening. As usual, one of the problem when spam is involved is defining if and what is a wrong doing and what is a  valid action. Some commenters say that Craigslist has become useless due to the spam, while others say that Craiglist is the worst censors on the Internet not letting small time businesses work.

For an artist that grew our of the Internet this presence is naturally very important, however he is now important enough that his record label was able to contact the different sites to get him his web properties back without paying the money.</p>

<p>In this case I have decided to categorize the attacked entity as Soulja Boy and not MySpace or YouTube, as I used to do in the past.

<p>The change was done using correct credentials to login to the administrative web site of Network Solutions, CheckFree domain registrar. It is yet unknown how the hackers got the credentials. Since <a href=""http://www.icann.org/en/committees/security/sac028.pdf"">Phishing attacks against domain registrars</a> including Network Solutions have started to surface recently, a good guess is that it was through a Phishing attack.</p>

<p>In addition, the information was syndicated from a French news agency. While apparently the agency did not have anything to do with the hack, the did catch some fire over the incident as some experts suggested it should help its customers to protect their systems.</p>

An interesting <a href=""http://www.viruslist.com/en/weblog?discuss=208187633&amp;return=1"">report </a>on Kasperski viruslist blog by a person on the investigating team provides answers: the data was neither secured well nor the hacker incapable. The hacker made a mistake in his attack vector and decided to pursue no further. The data was available for any hacker who was really after it.</p>

<p>I must tkae my hat off to Kasperski for this frank analysis, which is very uncommon to companies who were breached and can really help to highlight the importance of application security.</p>

<hr />

<p><em><strong>Update (Feb 13<sup>th</sup> 2009)</strong></em> - Kasperski hired David Litchfield, a well known database security expert, to analyze the incident. In their <a href=""http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207575753"">response, </a>Ksaperski point that no sensitive data was actually compromised  to the event. The report points that the hacker and others following his hints did try to access sensitive data but did not succeed. The carefully worded report does leave many questions open:</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>

<li>Was the data secured well, or were the hackers who tried to access it just not capable?</li>

<li>Was no data vulnerable or just ""sensitive data"" and if so what is the data that was exposed?</li>

<li>Did the investigation go back to check that no one hacked the system prior to the published incident, potentially abusing it and avoiding publication?</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>A researcher <a href=""http://hackersblog.org/2009/02/07/usakasperskycom-hacked-full-database-acces-sql-injection/"">found and exploited</a> a serious SQL injection vulnerability in US web site of Kasperski, an anti-virus software vendor, exposing the full customers database. Well, the full database actually as the list of tables exposed proves. <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/09/kaspersky_compromise_follow_up/"">Apparently</a>, the vulnerability existed for some time and the researched informed Kasperski about it to no avail before making it public.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This is another example of how fatal is SQL injection. SQL Injection is considered one of the more well understood attack vectors, easy to find during a security review, and therefore easy to get rid of. However one of its variants, blind SQL injection, can appear everywhere in the application and not just in key pages managing sensitive information and expose the entire database, making a review and fix of the application from it much harder.</p>",,7-Feb-09,SQL Injection,Improper Input Handling,Leakage of Information,Technology,,No,,,Romania,,,,,

<p>A Korean e-commerce site was hacked and a staggering number of record, 18 million, where stolen. In the US this would be front news. We don't know if it was front news in Korea, but did not get to the international media.</p>
<p>The attack description is vague but can be best described as session hijacking.</p>
<p>This incident is a great example of the lack of sufficient international coverage at WHID. Help us by sending us non English incidents! After all, it is not English speakers only that get hacked, but rather us, the WHID maintainers that speak only this language.</p>

Not a breathtaking achievement in the effort to make business care about web application security, yet a step in this direction. The report also identifies the attack as an SQL injection attack.</p>
<hr />
&lt;!--break-->
<p>Very detailed records of geeks.com customers were stolen from the site. The records included name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, expiration date, and most notoriously, card verification number (CVV).</p>
<p>The interesting part is that the site had a Hacker Safe seal. The seal was revoked twice last year due to vulnerabilities, but restored after they where patched. It seems that this time the hack preceded the scan or the scan missed the vulnerability. So much for application scanning and vulnerability assessment....</p>

According to investigation papers Maksym Yastremskiy made approximately 11 million dollars from the hack!</p>
<hr />
<p>The TJX breach is one of most publicized hacking incident in recent years. However, until now it was not part of the Web Hacking Incidents Database. And for a good reason: early report described the hack as a war driving hack, in which the attackers drive around and find a wireless network not properly secured.</p>
<p>However new information from the trial of the identity theft ring leader Albert Gonzalez, reveals that in order to penetrate TJX data center from the captured end points, the hackers employed different techniques including password sniffing and SQL injection. The later justifies getting the TJX incident for the 1st time into WHID.</p>

If<br />you wonder why, it is because organizations such as MLS only now find<br />out that they were hacked last year! Sometime between January and<br />August of 2007, names, addresses, credit and debit card data, and<br />passwords of an unknown number of people, including 169 New Hampshire<br />residents were stolen from the site.</p>
<p>Why New Hampshire? Because the company has to report to the<br />authorities there about the incidents, but only specify the number of<br />individuals from this state affected. Why only New Hampshire? Since<br />regulations and bills requiring disclosures exist in many states, one<br />would expect that the company would have to provide such a testimonial<br />in many states.

2007-82,WHID 2007-82: An SQL injection Mass Robot,"<p>An SQL injection robot is running wild and has already hacked hundreds of thousands of web sites. Since the robot plants malicious code in infected sites, its traces can be found by Googling for a name of Chinese sites referred to in malicious code.</p>

<p>As a security practitioner I often see SQL injection bots, and many times when I install ModSecurity, an open source application firewall but this bot is unique in the way it exploits web sites. It is easier to perform a wide scale attack by exploiting the least common denominator, which in the hacking world is the operating system. As a result most SQL bots tend to try to use SQL injection vectors that will enable issuing OS commands. A good example is a <a href=""http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21799/discuss"">Cacti vulnerability</a>: since it allows an OS command to be issued I often see bots looking for it in the wild. This attack is the first I have seen in which the actual attack vector is SQL based. The bot is modifying every record it has access to into a malicious code in the hope that it will be fetched and displayed by the application to its users.</p>

<p>A byproduct if this vector is that is that results are catastrophic for the site owners. While in a case of common defacement attacks restoring (or recreating) the homepage is all it required to get back to business, in this case the whole database is ruined. Considering the scope of the attack and that restoring the database, if it was ever backup, requires much more expertise, the overall damage of this attack is very high.</p>

According to the story and the following comments, it seems that the problem is plunging IPower for a long time without being resolved. Put in perspective the <a href=""byid_id_2007-75.shtml"">PlusNet incident</a> which was serious but swiftly handled and publicly acknowledged by the company.</p>
<p>Actually the problem is so dominant that a recent <a href=""http://stopbadware.org"">StopBadware</a> report lists Ipower as by far the most Malware infected hosting company. Reports mention that the problem started as early as mid 2006.
</p><p>The root cause of the breach here is mentioned as being a vulnerability in either Apache, PHP or cPanel. I have selected the third as being more probably until further evidence materialize.</p>

2007-72,WHID 2007-72: David Airey domains hijacked,"<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Update (Dec 30th 2008)</span></em></p>
<p>It seems that the original report was not accurate and it was not a CSRF vulnerablity that was exploited. The mistake is reported by the victim in an imaginary <a href=""http://www.davidairey.com/google-site-links-gmail-hack-search-penalty/"">discussion with Google</a> blog post (Search the page for XSRF) and by <a href=""http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/11/gmail-security-and-recent-phishing.html"">Google</a>. Google hints that it was a phishing attack, but David Airey is <a href=""http://www.davidairey.com/google-gmail-phishing-scam/"">not convinced</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Many times we dismiss seemingly minor vulnerabilities in major web sites. Most notably, ""yet another"" XSS or CSRF vulnerability in a well known service is not considered news anymore. However the following story proves that no matter what, such vulnerabilities cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The attack is simple, the result pretty frightening. An attacker, presumably Iranian, stole the domain name of David Airey, a graphic artist and a known blogger. The attack was very well timed with David's leaving to a long vacation. The goal was to extort money in order to return the domain. In David's case there is a happy end, as the attention he got helped him receive his blog back, with some loss in traffic, search engine ranking and time. But other victims of the attacker who steal domains for living may not be as fortunate.</p>

2007-65,WHID 2007-65: Facebook suing a porn site over automated access,"<p>Use of robots and automated software against a web site, as long as it is not done in order to break into the site, falls into a grey area. While hard to classify as an unlawful act, it is usually harmful to the site owner and possibly to the site users. Apart from using valuable resources, such an automated access may breach the site's usage license of public information and might also indicate unlawful activity such as using a botnet. Many times it is hard to know if such a blast of requests is a denial of service attack, brute force password cracking or just a search engine crawler.</p>
<p>Going forward we are going to add such incidents to WHID if there is a reason to believe that they are not friendly, even if the actual goal of the attack cannot be easily classified. The Facebook case at hand is a perfect example: while the details are not clear, the fact that Facebook filed a law suit implies that there is fire behind the smoke.</p>

2007-60,WHID 2007-60: The blog of a Cambridge University security team hacked,"<p>This story probably represents hundreds of similar stories. Many of us have come to rely on open source software, which is useful, feature reach and free. It enables us access to tools available to a few only a couple of years ago. The downside is that this easy availability means that many use the tools without having the time, resources and expertise to protect them. Systems such as <a href=""http://www.phpbb.com"">phpBB</a> and <a href=""http://www.wordpress.org"">WordPress</a> are good<br />examples of very popular open source systems that require constant<br />attention in order to maintain secure.</p>
<p>I am sure that the guys at Light Blue Touchpaper have the expertise to protect their WordPress installation, but they donåÕt have the time. They made the compromise between ease of management of their web site and its security. Actually my <a href=""http://blog.shezaf.com"">personal blog</a> might be just as vulnerable, since as I write this I am very much not paying attention to its security.</p>
<p>Apart from, or actually because of  the fact that the victims are security experts, this story is noteworthy due to two additional twists in the plot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero day exploit in the wild - the attacker penetrated twice, once using a known SQL injection vulnerability, but the second time using a yet unknown vulnerability in WordPress, which was reverse engineered and published for the first time by the people at Light Blue Touchpaper.</li>
<p></p>
<li>The researchers found that they can use Google to retrieve the hashed password of the hacker. Google has become so big that it actually allows efficient encrypted passwords lookup.</li>

2007-53,WHID 2007-53: Google&#039;s Advanced Search Operators Abused by Spammers,"<p>While most WHID entries are about web site breaches, sometimes vulnerability in a web application is used indirectly. Redirection functions in web applications are commonly used by spammers and phishers. It allows them to include a honest looking URL in their e-mail, this way bypassing spam filters and observant users.</p>
<p>Symantec response team found actively used alternative in the best known page on the internet: Google primary search page. By using the Google famous ""I feel lucky"" feature, the spammer can automatically lead the victim to the first result of a search. All the spammer is left with is finding a query for which his site would pop up first on Google.</p>
<p>This method has another advantage over a redirection page, as the final target is specified by a search string and not by a URL, bypassing smarter filters that know, or learn, that a URL as a parameter of a URL is most probably redirection.</p>

2007-42,WHID 2007-42: Bank of India seriously compromised,"<p>This very serious hacking incident provides insight into a lot<br />of the failures information security in general and web application<br />security particularly beyond the simple fact that the web site of the<br />largest state owned bank in India was invisibly defaced with Trojan<br />inflicting code.</p>
<p>Firstly, the entire discussion in the references is about the<br />Trojan payload, with no word about the vulnerability that led to the<br />defacement. Actually a reviewer on the SiteAdvisor report gives the<br />green mark to the web site after the Trojan is removed, without<br />requiring any information about the actual problem.</p>
<p>Secondly, most trust systems, including SiteAdvisor,<br />completely fail to detect the breach. Which makes me think about those<br />trust models: they check that the site was not breached, while they<br />should check that the site is not vulnerable. I guess the reason is<br />that their primary goal is to detect intentionally malicious sites and<br />not breaches is normative sites, but others use them to assess the<br />level of security of the later.<br /></p>

2005-65,WHID 2005-65: LexisNexis Data Breach,"<p>The LexisNexis data breach is not new, but we have recently decided to <a hre=""http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2007-65.shtml"">start tracking</a> abuse of insufficient automation measures and are adding historical incidents.</p>
<p>In this incident a group of people opened accounts at data broker LexisNexis and used automated tools to extract a large amount of personal information provided by the service.</p>
<p>As usual in such cases there is a question of whether the attack was a criminal activity, violation of the license agreement of the information provider or plainly legal. In this regard it is interesting to note that the group arrested in the incident was also responsible for the hacking to <a href="" http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/byid_id_2005-5.shtml"">Paris Hilton Vodafone account</a>, which was clearly an unlawful act.
</p><p>Back in 2005 this data breach was one of the first such incidents, generated a lot of media interest, and led to more regulation regarding information aggregators. Interestingly, the excuse given by the company was that the incident was that there was no security failure in the web site, but that the procedures where lacking. We accepted this story at the time, but today we believe that such automation and scraping attacks are among the most dangerous attacks.</p>

</p><p><br />As usual in such cases the actual way in which the information was stolen was not disclosed. A federal trade commission report on the incident, published only in 2007, revealed that the incident was a result on an SQL injection attack on Guidance servers. In a settlement with the FTC, Guidance agreed to implement a comprehensive information security program, including independent, third-party audits every other year for the next ten years.

At least on one page allowed accessing an account by only specifying the user name in the URL. The bug was open for 12 days before being discovered.
</p><p><br />The site was taken off line for 10 hours to fix the issue. It is a significant incident, as it is one of those rare occasions where vulnerability was serious enough to force the organization to just take the site off line until it is fixed.
</p><p><br />We somehow missed this story so it finds its way to WHID only now in late 2007.

2004-17,WHID 2004-17: The CardSystems breach was an SQL Injection hack (Updated),"<p><em><strong>Update (May 27th 2009)</strong></em> - The CardSystems incident is refusing to die. Merrick Back is now <a href=""http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/05/26/Merrick.pdf"">suing Savvis</a> for certifying CardSystems as CISP compliant while it systems where wide open. CISP is a VISA program for certifying credit card processing systems which existed prior to PCI DSS.</p>
<p>The actual damage to an organization of an attack is rarely disclosed, and coverage focuses on the Number_of_Records stolen. In the court documents Merrick reveals that its own damage from the CardSystems incident was $16,000,000! The money was paid to card holders to compensate for losses and for legal fees and fines.</p>
<p>The case is also interesting as it put to test the liability of the certifying entity (in this case Savvis) resulting from assessing. The results may have profound influence on the PCI QSA market and therefore PCI itself. David Navetta posts an <a href=""http://infoseccompliance.com/2009/06/03/merrick-bank-v-savvis-analysis-of-the-merrick-bank-complaint/"">excellent legal analysis</a> of the potential implications of the lawsuit.</p>
<hr />
<p>This entry is a very important one. Most are already familiar with the infamous CardSystems incident where hackers stole 263,000 credit card numbers, exposed 40 million more and several million dollars fraudulent credit and debit card purchases had been made with these counterfeit cards. As a result of the breach CardSystems nearly went out of business and was eventually purchased by PayByTouch. CardSystems is considered by many the most severe publicized information security breach ever and it caused company share holders, financial institutes and card holders damage of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>But since the publication of the incident a year ago the way in which the breach occurred remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Recently new articles about the case (listed below) revealed that SQL injection was used by the attackers to install malicious script on the CardSystems web application database which where scheduled to run every four days, extract records, zip them and export them to an FTP site.</p>
<p>This is one of the most stunning examples where a web application security hole was used to launch a targeted attack in order to steal money.</p>
