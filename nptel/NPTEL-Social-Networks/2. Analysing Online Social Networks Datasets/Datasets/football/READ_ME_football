Background

Our network example describes the 22 soccer teams which participated in the World Championship in Paris, 1998.

Players of the national team often have contracts in other countries. This constitutes a players market where national teams export players to other countries. Members of the 22 teams had contracts in altogether 35 countries.

Counting which team exports how many players to which country can be described with a valued, asymmetric graph. The graph is highly unsymmetric: some countries only export players, some countries are only importers.
